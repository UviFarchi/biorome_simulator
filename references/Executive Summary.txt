Executive Summary
Agrobots is redefining modern agriculture. We combine modular robotics, advanced sensors and data-driven intelligence to foster self-optimizing, regenerative ecosystems. Our unified platform, LandOS, orchestrates a network of drone-based imaging systems, in-soil sensors and robotic field modules into a seamless Terrain Management as a Service. Rather than selling hardware or software licenses, we operate farms end-to-end, delivering predictable productivity gains and measurable ecological restoration for a simple, fixed annual fee .
Today’s growers confront spiralling labor costs, volatile input prices and tightening environmental regulations that undermine margins and long-term viability. Conventional operations reliant on   manual processes and monolithic machinery struggle to adapt. Agrobots replaces these costly inputs with data-driven precision: our Analytics Engine ingests real-time field, aerial and market data; our Optimization Engine builds predictive models to prescribe exact interventions; and our Operations Engine executes those prescriptions autonomously, guiding each hectare toward peak performance and sustainability .
At the heart of our solution are Bio-Robotic Modular Ecosystems, or bioromes, in which plants, animals and microbes interact naturally within a high-tech framework. By blending biology and robotics, we reduce fertilizer, pesticide and water usage by 20–40%; improve yield reliability; and help clients meet or exceed climate and water-quality targets while dramatically reducing headcount. Each deployment grows smarter over time as LandOS learns from every sensor reading and robotic task, creating a powerful data moat and accelerating performance gains across our network .
Our go-to-market strategy targets large agribusinesses and cooperatives managing high-value crops in diverse regions, as well as landowners and local authorities which administer vast tracts of underutilized or abandoned land. We are establishing a showcase pilot biorome to demonstrate rapid return on investment, then expand through long-term contracts that align incentives around environmental and economic KPIs. Pricing is based on a simple per-hectare annual fee, ensuring recurring, high-margin revenue while delivering clear, measurable impact .
We have forged strategic collaborations with leading industrial partners across three critical categories: drone and electronics manufacturers that supply field-ready aerial platforms; sensor and IoT integrators who provide soil probes and microclimate stations; and agricultural equipment makers who adapt irrigation and cultivation tools for precision automation, allowing farmers to deploy ready-made solutions with minimal integration time. These partnerships enable us to integrate off-the-shelf components into a unified operational layer, scale rapidly without heavy capital investment and concentrate our efforts on intelligent terrain operation .


Having earned the European AI Innovation award and securing our strategic industrial partnerships, we are now focused on completing LandOS beta, launching full-scale pilot deployments and expanding our core team. These initiatives will showcase Agrobots’ ability to deploy modular, data-driven solutions that regenerate ecosystems, optimize resource use and drive sustainable productivity across diverse agricultural landscapes.
