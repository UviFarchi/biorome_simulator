/*
On TileInfo There should be:
1. 3 MetricsTables subcomponents, one for soil, one for topography, one for resources.
2. 2 BiotaTable subcomponents, one for plants, one for animals.
3. 1 AssembliesTable subcomponent
4. The common styles for all these components

The common functions they need for formatting of dates or names should come from /src/utils/formatting, not from TileInfo.
I feel I have a different implementation of formatting in every file, so let's start collecting and reusing.
