On MetricsTable there should be: 1. An expiry date column, which is the date on which the previous measurement is not valid anymore. 2. A previous value column in which the value of the measurement before the last is shown. 3. A current value column, in which the value of the last measurements is shown. 4. An optimized value column, that shows the effects of the optimized animals, plants and assemblies on the tile. 5. A delta column that can show they user the difference between any two columns they choose (like it currently works) The AssembliesTable subcomponent is new, and it simply shows the real assemblies on the tile with a list of their modules.
 There should be a second table with a single cell that contains any values in the optimized array of assemblies.
